# appunti
I miei appunti universitari scritti in latex

# Adding the package 'appunti'
On mac you need to copy the package to this location:

```
/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/latex/appunti/
```

On linux you need to copy the package here:

```
/usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/appunti/
```

Then run the command ```mktexlsr``` to update Latex's database
and reload any documents that needs to be compiled with that package.

(in Linux you have to run the command as superuser because it needs to access file that require root privileges)
